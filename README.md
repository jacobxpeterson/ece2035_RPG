# Final project for ECE 2035 at Georgia Tech.
Created a role playing game in C using an ARM mbed microcontroller, accelerometer, uLCD screen and two buttons. Resulted in a game in which the user could control a player sprite by tilting the board and interact with NPC and enemy sprites with the two buttons.
